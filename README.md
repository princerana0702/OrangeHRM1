OrangeHRM Automation Sample Project  using Selenium Java and TestNG
### **Requirement Scoping:**
2. **Identify Test Scenarios:** Break down the application into testable scenarios. Prioritize critical functionalities and features that need automation.
3. **Define Test Cases:** Write clear, detailed test cases covering various scenarios to be automated.
4. **Select Tools and Frameworks:** Choose Java as the programming language, Selenium WebDriver for web automation, and TestNG as the testing framework.

### **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

**Setup Project:â€”done**
    - Create a new Java project in your preferred IDE.
    - Add necessary dependencies (Selenium WebDriver, TestNG) via Maven or by manually importing the required libraries.
2. **Write Test Cases:**
    - Create Java classes for each test case or scenario.
    - Use TestNG annotations like **`@Test`**, **`@BeforeMethod`**, **`@AfterMethod`**, etc., to structure and manage tests.
    - Utilize Selenium WebDriver commands to interact with the web elements (find elements, click, input text, etc.).
    - Implement assertions to validate expected outcomes.

3. **Handle Test Data and Environment Configuration:**
    - Manage test data separately (e.g., in Excel, properties file, or database).
    - Set up environment configurations (e.g., URLs, browser configurations) that can be easily modified.
4. **Logging and Reporting:**
    - Implement logging to capture important events and errors during test execution.
    - Configure TestNG listeners or reporting tools (like ExtentReports) for detailed test reports.
5. **Run and Debug Tests:**
    - Execute tests locally to ensure they function as expected.
    - Use debugging tools in your IDE to troubleshoot any issues.
6. **Version Control and CI/CD Integration:**
    - Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage code changes.
